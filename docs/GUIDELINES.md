# Goals

I am an experienced Aussie Developer with a quirky sense of humour, I want clean subtle
humour in wording - friendly without being "in your face"! I value well-thought-out succinct code that is clear. KISS
rules apply.

## AI Interaction Principles

- Respect existing working code style and design decisions
- Minimize unnecessary rewrites
- Prioritize incremental improvements
- Ask clarifying questions before major changes
- Solve problems with the smallest possible intervention
- When in doubt, propose the least invasive solution

## AI Development Approach

### Understanding Requirements

- Always check SPEC.md and related `SPEC-*.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION-*.md` files first for exact requirements
- Don't make assumptions about data formats or processing rules
- Ask for clarification if requirements seem ambiguous
- Remember that simpler is usually better

## Code Quality Principles

- Write code that is immediately understandable
- Prioritize clarity over cleverness
- Comments explain "why" (only needed when it is not obvious), code explains "how" (try and make code more readable
  first)
- Keep functions short and focused (under 20 lines)
- Keep files focused on a single clear responsibility (under 200 lines)
- Choose readable meaningful variable names over terse ones
- Write code optimized for developer efficiency whilst avoiding excessive run times, follow Knuth's recommendation:
    - In Donald Knuth's paper "Structured Programming With Go To Statements", he wrote:
      "Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about,
      the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually
      have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered.
      We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time:
      premature optimization is the root of all evil.
      Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%."
- When in doubt, err on the side of simplicity and clarity
- Value code that communicates intent clearly over clever optimizations
- Measure efficiency by how quickly another developer can understand and modify the code

## Best Practices

Follow [Agile](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/) best practices including as elaborated in

* [The Agile Samurai](https://www.pragprog.com/titles/jtrap/the-agile-samurai/)
    * [Inception Deck](https://agilewarrior.wordpress.com/2010/11/06/the-agile-inception-deck/)

Language specific guidelines:

* [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/rubocop/ruby-style-guide)
* [PEP 8 â€“ Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
* [Ansible for Devops](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/index.html)

## AI Behavioral Safeguards

- Code is for communication between developers, not just instructions for the CPU
- Prefer confirming understanding over ending up rewriting
- Demonstrate your reasoning when proposing changes / alternative solutions
- Prefer the simpler minimal path to solving the problem
- Explicitly state why a change or alternative solution is necessary
- Focus primarily on completing the requested task.
    - If uncertain, ask clarifying questions first before proceeding
    - Present suggestions (beyond the scope of the request) as succinct bullet points immediately in your response
      This allows me to decide whether to:
        - Interrupt the current work to discuss your suggestion
        - Note it for later consideration
        - Or set it aside
- Don't [Write code you don't need!](https://daedtech.com/dont-write-code-you-dont-need/) it adds extra technical debt
  and is a code smell, not a benefit!
- When suggesting improvements, separate them clearly from the requested implementation

## Defensive Programming Principles

- Treat all external input as potentially hostile and/or broken
- Validate and sanitize inputs rigorously
- Fail fast and explicitly when assumptions are violated
- Use language-specific safety mechanisms
- Prefer restrictive parsing over permissive methods
- Prioritize code clarity over excessively detailed defensive checks
- Remember: Code is a communication tool, not just machine instructions

### Code Development

- Focus on one component at a time
- Avoid over-engineering or adding unnecessary complexity
- Pay special attention to resource cleanup and error handling
- Consider edge cases but don't over-optimize prematurely

### Process Management

- Handle external processes carefully (initialization, cleanup)
- Use proper error handling for system calls
- Ensure resources are released appropriately
- Consider signal handling where appropriate

### Data Processing

- Follow specified rules exactly - don't add "improvements" without discussion
- Watch for assumptions about input formats
- Be careful with memory usage for larger datasets
- Consider rate limits when accessing external services

### Testing & Development

- Use limit parameters during development when available
- Test with small datasets first
- Verify output formats carefully
- Check resource cleanup during normal and error conditions
- Use VCR / Webmock to record / mock external resources, Use REAL internal objects - don't mock them (Test reality, NOT
  a mock-up of what we hope is there!)

## Common AI Pitfalls to Avoid

- Adding complexity that wasn't requested
- Making assumptions about "standard" ways to process data
- Trying to optimize too early
- Missing cleanup of external resources
- Over-commenting obvious code
- Under-documenting complex logic - mainly a problem with obscuring what the code is doing with fluff comments rather
  than actually explaining why, and making sure code explain how abd what it is doing
- Losing focus on the primary request by pursuing tangential improvements
- Prioritizing computer efficiency over developer comprehension

## Communication

- Ask questions when requirements are unclear
- Propose simplifications when possible
- Identify potential issues early
- Be explicit about implementation trade-offs

## My Preferences

## Development style

* Progressive enhancement - Start with the simplest solution that works, then improve incrementally as needed rather
  than trying to build the perfect solution upfront (goes with "You don't really know what you will discover or learn in
  the future")
* Dependency management - Be thoughtful about which external libraries you include; each adds maintenance burden
    * explicitly document via Gemfile for ruby or requirements.txt for python
* I use Automated formatting/linting - Rubocop (for Ruby) or Black/Flake8 (for Python) to enforce consistency with less
  effort

### Error Handling Preferences

* Exception-based: Use exceptions for truly exceptional conditions, with custom exception classes
* Return values + logging: Return nil/false for expected failures, log details
* Early returns: Check conditions at start of methods and return early
* Defensive programming: Validate inputs we rely on, assume everything can fail
* Contextual errors: Include context in error messages (what was being processed)

### Testing Philosophy

* lightweight BDD approach appropriate for a personal project: Focus on behavior specifications first, with a cycle of
    * expect something to happen,
    * write enough implementation to see what we actually get back and likely side issues
    * update our understanding and adjust expected behaviour as appropriate

* Test reality not mock-ups of how we expect the world works - use VCR to cache real examples, and Webmock to test when
  the outside world misbehaves

### Documentation Style

* Minimal docs: Self-documenting code with docs only for complex logic
* Example-driven: Include usage examples in docs ONLY when its not clear
* Inline comments: Focus on inline comments over formal method docs
* Intent documentation: Document the "why" not the "what"
* Architecture docs: Separate high-level architecture documents into docs/IMPLEMENTATION-*.md when it applies to
  multiple files

### Naming Conventions

* Concise but clear: Shorter names that are still descriptive
* Domain-specific language: Names that mirror the business domain
* Contextual naming: Names that reflect the context they're used in
* Action-based: Verb-first for methods that change state (e.g., calculate_total)
* Queries should be nouns (eg "address") or a question when it returns a boolean (eg "valid?)
* Consistency over conventions: Team consistency trumps external conventions

### Performance Considerations

* Optimize for readability and maintainability first: Performance concerns secondary to clarity

Remember: The AI's role is to implement the specified requirements accurately and simply, not to enhance them without
discussion.
