NEW Projects
============

Copy GUIDELINES.md and SPECS.md to "project instructions" for new Projects

NEW Chats
=========

Start new chats with:

I want help with ....

But FIRST read each point in the "project knowledge" CAREFULLY and list the points that differ from YOUR standard practices.
This will form a mutually agreed basis for working together that lines up with my preferences. 
Keep the guidelines in mind all the way through the ongoing chat.
Ignore the "shar_format" until I ask for a shar file.
