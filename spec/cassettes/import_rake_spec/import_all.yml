        am adding this PR because the util gem helps me debug issues and it reduces
        the load on the servers we scrape.\r\n\r\nAlso\r\n- Added bin/console for
        quick irb investigations\r\n- MORPH_EXPECT_BAD defaults to the sites we expect
        bad\r\n\r\nThis uses [scraper-utils](https://rubygems.org/gems/scraper_utils)
        gem , whose benefits include being :\r\n\r\n- Allowing server admin to specify
        a crawl delay for us in robots.txt\r\n- adding a delay based on the response
        time between requests, so we A. don''t flood the server, and B. we throttle
        back when the server is under load\r\n- adding a random minimum delay (approx
        5 seconds) to be less bot like\r\n- Setting a less generic user agent and
        more appropriate headers\r\n- interleaving requests so we can other useful
        work in between requests to any one server \r\n  - Note interleaving adds
        enough delay between the requests to any one server that it doesn''t actually
        need to sleep much, for example my last test on morph.io:\r\n  - `FiberScheduler
        processed 217 calls to delay for 32 registrations, sleeping 9.2% (109.5) of
        the 1192.5 seconds requested`\r\n- Added MORPH_AUTHORITIES to save 1/2 hour
        testing wagga\r\n- Added DEBUG=1 so I can easily see what calls here being
        made and the page returned when selectors failed\r\n- added default MORPH_EXPECT_BAD=wagga
        to stop morph complaining about the broken site\r\n\r\nMy utilities can get
        reused, just calling rather than adding the whole code, in each multi repo.\r\nIt
        was extracted out of the big \"BEN HUR\" PR and refined from there on my own
        time.\r\n\r\nNote - I will be basing future PRs on this PR because it helps
        me so much and makes morph testing practical and efficient for me.\r\nIt tells

        am adding this PR because the util gem helps me debug issues and it reduces
        the load on the servers we scrape.\r\n\r\nAlso\r\n- Added bin/console for
        quick irb investigations\r\n- MORPH_EXPECT_BAD defaults to the sites we expect
        bad\r\n\r\nThis uses [scraper-utils](https://rubygems.org/gems/scraper_utils)
        gem , whose benefits include being :\r\n\r\n- Allowing server admin to specify
        a crawl delay for us in robots.txt\r\n- adding a delay based on the response
        time between requests, so we A. don''t flood the server, and B. we throttle
        back when the server is under load\r\n- adding a random minimum delay (approx
        5 seconds) to be less bot like\r\n- Setting a less generic user agent and
        more appropriate headers\r\n- interleaving requests so we can other useful
        work in between requests to any one server \r\n  - Note interleaving adds
        enough delay between the requests to any one server that it doesn''t actually
        need to sleep much, for example my last test on morph.io:\r\n  - `FiberScheduler
        processed 217 calls to delay for 32 registrations, sleeping 9.2% (109.5) of
        the 1192.5 seconds requested`\r\n- Added MORPH_AUTHORITIES to save 1/2 hour
        testing wagga\r\n- Added DEBUG=1 so I can easily see what calls here being
        made and the page returned when selectors failed\r\n- added default MORPH_EXPECT_BAD=wagga
        to stop morph complaining about the broken site\r\n\r\nMy utilities can get
        reused, just calling rather than adding the whole code, in each multi repo.\r\nIt
        was extracted out of the big \"BEN HUR\" PR and refined from there on my own
        time.\r\n\r\nNote - I will be basing future PRs on this PR because it helps
        me so much and makes morph testing practical and efficient for me.\r\nIt tells
        you the config at the start of the log:\r\n```\r\nScraping authorities: blacktown,

        All ''Unknown value of determination type'' are now marked decision: \"unknown\"
        \r\n  * Come back to this when we actually use these values\r\n  * Previously
        Fixed cessnock - Added 7 new `determinations for` as UNKNOWN and flagged TODO
        review\r\n  * Previously Fixed lismore - now treats blank determination type
        as unknown instead of crashing\r\n* Added maintenance detection, for example:\r\n    *
        fairfield - at 4AM was reporting in Maintenance mode (Add to MORPH_EXPECT_POOR
        if it continues for days)\r\n* Created https://github.com/ianheggie/down_under
        project for my own australian proxy\r\n  (A Public project - you will need
        to pay for your own linode VPS)\r\n* Set STDOUT/STDERR to flush messages immediately
        so the morph.io log is in correct order\r\n* If MORPH_AUSTRALIAN_PROXY is
        set, the scraper tries a third and last time without the proxy\r\n* Refreshed
        external site cache so we are testing what the sites do now not in the past!\r\n    *
        Added rake task and code to make it simple in the future\r\n* Added filters
        to make testing and development quicker (See README.md)\r\n* Added DEBUG env
        variable to enable more verbose debug info\r\n* Handle Terms And Conditions
        page that appears after search form submitted\r\n* Changed from hard coded
        vcr cache date to spec/vcr_date.txt to make refreshing cache simple\r\n* added
        gitignore for temp files and modern tools \r\n* Upgraded to heroku-18 platform
        and ruby 3.2.2 with more recent gems (that still work on that platform)\r\n*
        Refactored code so we can test exactly what scraper runs.\r\n* Refreshed vcr
        cache and expected records to test against a recent copy of council results","created_at":"2025-02-11T05:23:24Z","updated_at":"2025-03-29T04:38:16Z","closed_at":"2025-02-17T23:35:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9d12d4badb4ee08185fcd604c95f2b1edbb4c08c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1419514172,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDE5NTE0MTcy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/planningalerts-scrapers/multiple_masterview/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"d73a4a","default":true,"description":"Something

        the load on the servers we scrape.\r\n\r\nAlso\r\n- Added bin/console for
        quick irb investigations\r\n- MORPH_EXPECT_BAD defaults to the sites we expect
        bad\r\n\r\nThis uses [scraper-utils](https://rubygems.org/gems/scraper_utils)
        gem , whose benefits include being :\r\n\r\n- Allowing server admin to specify
        a crawl delay for us in robots.txt\r\n- adding a delay based on the response
        time between requests, so we A. don''t flood the server, and B. we throttle
        back when the server is under load\r\n- adding a random minimum delay (approx
        5 seconds) to be less bot like\r\n- Setting a less generic user agent and
        more appropriate headers\r\n- interleaving requests so we can other useful
        work in between requests to any one server \r\n  - Note interleaving adds
        enough delay between the requests to any one server that it doesn''t actually
        need to sleep much, for example my last test on morph.io:\r\n  - `FiberScheduler
        processed 217 calls to delay for 32 registrations, sleeping 9.2% (109.5) of
        the 1192.5 seconds requested`\r\n- Added MORPH_AUTHORITIES to save 1/2 hour
        testing wagga\r\n- Added DEBUG=1 so I can easily see what calls here being
        made and the page returned when selectors failed\r\n- added default MORPH_EXPECT_BAD=wagga
        to stop morph complaining about the broken site\r\n\r\nMy utilities can get
        reused, just calling rather than adding the whole code, in each multi repo.\r\nIt
        was extracted out of the big \"BEN HUR\" PR and refined from there on my own
        time.\r\n\r\nNote - I will be basing future PRs on this PR because it helps
        me so much and makes morph testing practical and efficient for me.\r\nIt tells
        you the config at the start of the log:\r\n```\r\nScraping authorities: blacktown,

        am adding this PR because the util gem helps me debug issues and it reduces
        the load on the servers we scrape.\r\n\r\nAlso\r\n- Added bin/console for
        quick irb investigations\r\n- MORPH_EXPECT_BAD defaults to the sites we expect
        bad\r\n\r\nThis uses [scraper-utils](https://rubygems.org/gems/scraper_utils)
        gem , whose benefits include being :\r\n\r\n- Allowing server admin to specify
        a crawl delay for us in robots.txt\r\n- adding a delay based on the response
        time between requests, so we A. don''t flood the server, and B. we throttle
        back when the server is under load\r\n- adding a random minimum delay (approx
        5 seconds) to be less bot like\r\n- Setting a less generic user agent and
        more appropriate headers\r\n- interleaving requests so we can other useful
        work in between requests to any one server \r\n  - Note interleaving adds
        enough delay between the requests to any one server that it doesn''t actually
        need to sleep much, for example my last test on morph.io:\r\n  - `FiberScheduler
        processed 217 calls to delay for 32 registrations, sleeping 9.2% (109.5) of
        the 1192.5 seconds requested`\r\n- Added MORPH_AUTHORITIES to save 1/2 hour
        testing wagga\r\n- Added DEBUG=1 so I can easily see what calls here being
        made and the page returned when selectors failed\r\n- added default MORPH_EXPECT_BAD=wagga
        to stop morph complaining about the broken site\r\n\r\nMy utilities can get
        reused, just calling rather than adding the whole code, in each multi repo.\r\nIt
        was extracted out of the big \"BEN HUR\" PR and refined from there on my own
        time.\r\n\r\nNote - I will be basing future PRs on this PR because it helps
        me so much and makes morph testing practical and efficient for me.\r\nIt tells
        you the config at the start of the log:\r\n```\r\nScraping authorities: blacktown,

        All ''Unknown value of determination type'' are now marked decision: \"unknown\"
        \r\n  * Come back to this when we actually use these values\r\n  * Previously
        Fixed cessnock - Added 7 new `determinations for` as UNKNOWN and flagged TODO
        review\r\n  * Previously Fixed lismore - now treats blank determination type
        as unknown instead of crashing\r\n* Added maintenance detection, for example:\r\n    *
        fairfield - at 4AM was reporting in Maintenance mode (Add to MORPH_EXPECT_POOR
        if it continues for days)\r\n* Created https://github.com/ianheggie/down_under
        project for my own australian proxy\r\n  (A Public project - you will need
        to pay for your own linode VPS)\r\n* Set STDOUT/STDERR to flush messages immediately
        so the morph.io log is in correct order\r\n* If MORPH_AUSTRALIAN_PROXY is
        set, the scraper tries a third and last time without the proxy\r\n* Refreshed
        external site cache so we are testing what the sites do now not in the past!\r\n    *
        Added rake task and code to make it simple in the future\r\n* Added filters
        to make testing and development quicker (See README.md)\r\n* Added DEBUG env
        variable to enable more verbose debug info\r\n* Handle Terms And Conditions
        page that appears after search form submitted\r\n* Changed from hard coded
        vcr cache date to spec/vcr_date.txt to make refreshing cache simple\r\n* added
        gitignore for temp files and modern tools \r\n* Upgraded to heroku-18 platform
        and ruby 3.2.2 with more recent gems (that still work on that platform)\r\n*
        Refactored code so we can test exactly what scraper runs.\r\n* Refreshed vcr

        the load on the servers we scrape.\r\n\r\nAlso\r\n- Added bin/console for
        quick irb investigations\r\n- MORPH_EXPECT_BAD defaults to the sites we expect
        bad\r\n\r\nThis uses [scraper-utils](https://rubygems.org/gems/scraper_utils)
        gem , whose benefits include being :\r\n\r\n- Allowing server admin to specify
        a crawl delay for us in robots.txt\r\n- adding a delay based on the response
        time between requests, so we A. don''t flood the server, and B. we throttle
        back when the server is under load\r\n- adding a random minimum delay (approx
        5 seconds) to be less bot like\r\n- Setting a less generic user agent and
        more appropriate headers\r\n- interleaving requests so we can other useful
        work in between requests to any one server \r\n  - Note interleaving adds
        enough delay between the requests to any one server that it doesn''t actually
        need to sleep much, for example my last test on morph.io:\r\n  - `FiberScheduler
        processed 217 calls to delay for 32 registrations, sleeping 9.2% (109.5) of
        the 1192.5 seconds requested`\r\n- Added MORPH_AUTHORITIES to save 1/2 hour
        testing wagga\r\n- Added DEBUG=1 so I can easily see what calls here being
        made and the page returned when selectors failed\r\n- added default MORPH_EXPECT_BAD=wagga
        to stop morph complaining about the broken site\r\n\r\nMy utilities can get
        reused, just calling rather than adding the whole code, in each multi repo.\r\nIt
        was extracted out of the big \"BEN HUR\" PR and refined from there on my own
        time.\r\n\r\nNote - I will be basing future PRs on this PR because it helps
        me so much and makes morph testing practical and efficient for me.\r\nIt tells
        you the config at the start of the log:\r\n```\r\nScraping authorities: blacktown,

        am adding this PR because the util gem helps me debug issues and it reduces
        the load on the servers we scrape.\r\n\r\nAlso\r\n- Added bin/console for
        quick irb investigations\r\n- MORPH_EXPECT_BAD defaults to the sites we expect
        bad\r\n\r\nThis uses [scraper-utils](https://rubygems.org/gems/scraper_utils)
        gem , whose benefits include being :\r\n\r\n- Allowing server admin to specify
        a crawl delay for us in robots.txt\r\n- adding a delay based on the response
        time between requests, so we A. don''t flood the server, and B. we throttle
        back when the server is under load\r\n- adding a random minimum delay (approx
        5 seconds) to be less bot like\r\n- Setting a less generic user agent and
        more appropriate headers\r\n- interleaving requests so we can other useful
        work in between requests to any one server \r\n  - Note interleaving adds
        enough delay between the requests to any one server that it doesn''t actually
        need to sleep much, for example my last test on morph.io:\r\n  - `FiberScheduler
        processed 217 calls to delay for 32 registrations, sleeping 9.2% (109.5) of
        the 1192.5 seconds requested`\r\n- Added MORPH_AUTHORITIES to save 1/2 hour
        testing wagga\r\n- Added DEBUG=1 so I can easily see what calls here being
        made and the page returned when selectors failed\r\n- added default MORPH_EXPECT_BAD=wagga
        to stop morph complaining about the broken site\r\n\r\nMy utilities can get
        reused, just calling rather than adding the whole code, in each multi repo.\r\nIt
        was extracted out of the big \"BEN HUR\" PR and refined from there on my own
        time.\r\n\r\nNote - I will be basing future PRs on this PR because it helps
        me so much and makes morph testing practical and efficient for me.\r\nIt tells
        you the config at the start of the log:\r\n```\r\nScraping authorities: blacktown,

        All ''Unknown value of determination type'' are now marked decision: \"unknown\"
        \r\n  * Come back to this when we actually use these values\r\n  * Previously
        Fixed cessnock - Added 7 new `determinations for` as UNKNOWN and flagged TODO
        review\r\n  * Previously Fixed lismore - now treats blank determination type
        as unknown instead of crashing\r\n* Added maintenance detection, for example:\r\n    *
        fairfield - at 4AM was reporting in Maintenance mode (Add to MORPH_EXPECT_POOR
        if it continues for days)\r\n* Created https://github.com/ianheggie/down_under
        project for my own australian proxy\r\n  (A Public project - you will need
        to pay for your own linode VPS)\r\n* Set STDOUT/STDERR to flush messages immediately
        so the morph.io log is in correct order\r\n* If MORPH_AUSTRALIAN_PROXY is
        set, the scraper tries a third and last time without the proxy\r\n* Refreshed
        external site cache so we are testing what the sites do now not in the past!\r\n    *
        Added rake task and code to make it simple in the future\r\n* Added filters
        to make testing and development quicker (See README.md)\r\n* Added DEBUG env
        variable to enable more verbose debug info\r\n* Handle Terms And Conditions
        page that appears after search form submitted\r\n* Changed from hard coded
        vcr cache date to spec/vcr_date.txt to make refreshing cache simple\r\n* added
        gitignore for temp files and modern tools \r\n* Upgraded to heroku-18 platform
        and ruby 3.2.2 with more recent gems (that still work on that platform)\r\n*
        Refactored code so we can test exactly what scraper runs.\r\n* Refreshed vcr
        cache and expected records to test against a recent copy of council results","created_at":"2025-02-11T05:23:24Z","updated_at":"2025-03-29T04:38:16Z","closed_at":"2025-02-17T23:35:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9d12d4badb4ee08185fcd604c95f2b1edbb4c08c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1419514172,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDE5NTE0MTcy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/planningalerts-scrapers/multiple_masterview/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"d73a4a","default":true,"description":"Something
